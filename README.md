# Using Whisper AI and GPT-3

## Overview

I used Whisper and GPT-3 (text-davinci-002) to create a app that transcribes a healthcare providers' speech into text!
Here's why:
* Providers spend a ton of time writing documentation, and often use voice transcription services
* Patients often don't understand medical jargon, and it's extra work for providers to re-write their case notes
* So, this tool could be used to generate a 'case summary' that is succinct and easy to read for patients.
